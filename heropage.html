  <p>My Aunt Rachel (Pagh in Klingon) is a software engineer who has worked for many technology companies. She speaks Klingon, and attends many of the Star Trek conventions. Currently, she is working on creating software for large scale 3d printers. 

  <p>I chose her as my hero because she is a really nice person, loves cats, and is very good with computers and science fiction. She has mentored me to make my coding more elegant, and even let me write a bit of code for his job! </p>
