  <p>My Uncle Eric (Pagh in Klingon) is a software engineer who has worked for many technology companies. He speaks Klingon, and attends many of the Star Trek conventions. Currently, he is working on creating software for large scale 3d printers. 

  <p>I chose him as my hero because he is a really nice person, loves cats, and is very good with computers and science fiction. He has mentored me to make my coding more elegant, and even let me write a bit of code for his job! </p>

      Did you make a mistake going here? If you want, you can go <a href="index.html">back</a>, but I would prefer if you just stayed here... :)
